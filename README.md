# Coding Challenge

As part of a coding challenge, I digitalized a registration form.

## Technology

It uses React and Typescript as technologies.
A simple styling was done with Bootstrap 3.

## Features

To get a more modern web form feel, the user can set the number of family members.
The app than displays the part of the registration form accordingly.

The submit button offers the user the form data as download (json)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

`npm test`

`npm run build`
